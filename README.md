# train-scheduler
The application will maintain a record of trains based on their start time and will provide minutes till arrival and arrival time on refresh. App is connected to a Firebase database for live updates.

A noted bug after latest pushes were made had the styling links break and page would appear broken. CTRL+SHIFT+R would fix issue after several inputs.

Future possible updates to include: refresh styling fix, API integration pulling live train data (further research necessary).
